# Embracing Serendipity: From Biochemistry to Data Visualization — Two Unique Journeys Unite

> Alenka Guček and Matthias Stahl

This repository contains the website of a talk and presentation during the Information+ conference in Edinburgh, 2023.

## Talk abstract

In the dynamic world of data visualization, diverse paths often converge to
create captivating narratives. Alenka and Matthias, once biochemists turned
data visualization professionals, share their transformative journeys.
Making the switch to dataviz from being academic fellows in Sweden, they
talk about their paths when their passions for visualization ignited.
Alenka's fascination with molecular intricacies pushed her beyond
traditional charts, merging her love for molecular structures with artistic
visualization. Matthias, on the other hand, found his passion during his
postdoc tenure in Stockholm, using data art to communicate complex
information effectively. Their stories reveal shared enthusiasm for
impactful visualizations, bridging scientific exploration and community
engagement. Regardless of their academic origins, their journeys underscore
the power of pursuing true passions. In this presentation, we explore Alenka
and Matthias' parallel experiences, celebrating diverse paths into data
visualization. We invite the community to reflect on their unique journeys
for shared understanding and discovery.
